This application is a School Management System built using Python’s Tkinter library. It allows a user to maintain basic student records and academic reports in a simple and friendly graphical interface. When the program starts, a welcome screen appears with a button that leads to the main dashboard. Every screen has a soft pastel background to make the interface visually pleasant.

From the dashboard, the user can add a new student by entering their name, ID, grade, and attendance percentage. The system stores the student in memory and confirms that the entry has been added successfully. The user can also display all students in a scrollable table to review information at any time.

The system also provides a feature to add subject-wise marks for students through the report section. The user needs to enter the student’s ID, the subject name, and the marks scored. If the student exists, the report is stored, and the user receives a confirmation. All reports collected in the system can be viewed together on a separate screen, also shown in tabular format for easy reading.

To maintain privacy and security, adding a student or adding a report requires a password, ensuring that only authorized people can modify important information. The system also includes a safe exit button, which first confirms whether the user really wants to close the application before shutting it down.

Overall, this project provides a neat structure for small-scale student record management and demonstrates the use of Tkinter, object-oriented programming, and interactive interface design in Python.
